# burger
 A restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
 
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page...waiting to be devoured.
 
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When clicked, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

this app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
